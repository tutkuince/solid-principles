     * Single Responsibility Principle
     *
     * The single responsibility principle revolves around the claim that a certain
     * code module (most often, a class) should only have responsibility over
     * one part of the functionality provided by the software. In software engineering books,
     * this is sometimes also defined like this: the module should only have one reason to change.
     * This means that a division of concerns is performed in the program, and the methods for every concern
     * should be completely encapsulated by a single class. Now it is obvious that this approach contributes
     * to the high cohesion – since methods related to the same concern (same part of the functionality)
     * will be members of the same class, and robustness – since this reduces the possibility of error.
     * Furthermore, if an error does occur, the programmer will be more likely to find the cause, and finally,
     * solve the problem.
     *
     * The single responsibility principle is founded on one of the basic, general ideas of object-oriented programming
     * – the so-called divide and conquer principle – solving a problem by solving its multiple sub-problems.
     * This approach prevents the creation of “God objects” – objects that “know too much or do too much“.
     *
     * The classes you write, should not be a swiss army knife. They should do one thing, and to that one thing well.
